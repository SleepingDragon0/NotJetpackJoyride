üìù About The Project
NotJetpackJoyride is an attempt to recreate JetPack Joyride within 

- Delegated tasks to accomodate the production of the game over a 10 week span

I did this using Slack as well in class delegation. The tasks delegated had descriptions and sometimes images to show how we wanted something to be made for the game. Tasks were assigned to individuals who either had previous experience working in that field or those who were interested in learning the designated topic. For example, one of the members was tasked to create a zapper similar to the one in another game.


- Managed the group of programmers/ designers over Slack and Github Project

Slack is a common easy to use platform that many developers use. We decided to use Slack because we were told that it is good programming industry practice as well as it being similar to another app all of us had used before, being discord. This made the process a lot more relaxed, as I was able to be in touch every week with other classmates also working on the project.

This code was done using the in engine unity command
